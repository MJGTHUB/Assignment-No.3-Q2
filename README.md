# Assignment-No.3-Q2

Assignment 03 - Q2. A hospital wants to determine whether there is any difference in the average Turn Around Time (TAT) of reports of the laboratories on their preferred list. They collected a random sample and recorded TAT for reports of 4 laboratories. TAT is defined as sample collected to report dispatch. Analyze the data and determine whether there is any difference in average TAT among the different laboratories at 5% significance level.
--> Analysis of variance between more than 2 samples(Laboratories) - so we are using here 'Anova ftest statistics'
Assume,
H0 : there is no significant difference in the average Turn Around Time (TAT)
H1 : there is significant difference in the average Turn Around Time (TAT) (at least one mean is different.)
